Domesticated System Report

**Domesticated System Report** is based on [Feral Linux Scripts](https://github.com/FeralInteractive/ferallinuxscripts) by [Feral Interactive](https://www.feralinteractive.com/).

This is a fairly simple zero dependency (except bash) system report script that gathers information about the local system. It outputs a file in HTML syntax.

Usage
